frequency.c: takes in an input of characters and provides a table with a break down of what percentage
	     of the total characters each character occupied, the minimum used characters and the
	     maximum used characters.

enocde_bits.c: Takes in a flag (or defaults to binary) and encodes any valid input to the base of
	       the flag.

decode_bits.c: Takes in a flag (or defaults to decimal) and decodes any valid input to the base of
	       the flag. 

bits.c: Utilizes helper functions in order to print binary bits or encode bits of any base. 

bits.h: Header file containing non static methods used in bits.c.

getnum.c: Utilizes helper functions in order to take in characters and perform encoding and decoding
	  of the bits. 

getnum.h: Header file containing non static methods used in getnum.c.

Makefile: Compiles files into executables.

The file containing getnum() (getnum.c) isn't an executable, it can be accessed through using the
correct flag (or no flag) and then entering valid input in ./encode_bits and ./decode_bits. It can
also be accessed through calling any of the ./tobase executables (binary, hex, octal, decimal) with
the format "echo ___valid_value(s)___ | ___valid_base_executable(s)___. It signals the validity of 
the base through the helper function validate_base which will return the value of the base if the 
input is valid and -1 otherwise.

No compilation problems (warnings or errors) are currently present in my code.
